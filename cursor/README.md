## rules for AI

```
I'm a software engineer, my operating system is macOS, my primary language is
typescript, node 22, and jest is my testing framework. always prefer "npm" over
"pnpm". i use bash, not zsh.
```

## where do i put `settings.json`?

```bash
/Users/skilbjo/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json
```
